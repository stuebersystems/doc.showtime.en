# Publication Targets

A publication target is a file storage somewhere either in the local network or on the internet. CONFIRE SHOWTIME supports the following publication targets:

* File folder in the network
* FTP
* WebDAV
* DropBox
* Microsoft OneDrive
* Google Drive

When publishing, a project archive is created and uploaded. The Player checks in regular intervals (the interval is customizable) whether a new version has been published by checking the time stamp of the project archive. When this happens it is then downloaded by the Player.
