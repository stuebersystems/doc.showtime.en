# Screen Resolutions

CONFIRE SHOWTIME DESIGNER allows you to create any number of Master Layouts. Thus you can define any number of target resolutions. And as the number of Showcases isn't limited either, a single SHOWTIME project can manage content for multiple public displays.

An example for a Layout Structure:

````
Master Layout 1 (1920 x 1080, Landscape)
-- Layout 1
-- Layout 2
-- Layout 3
Master Layout 2 (1920 x 1080, Portrait)
-- Layout 1
-- Layout 2
-- Layout 3
````

The project can therefore define two different Showcases. A Showcase for a full HD resolution in Landscape and a Showcase for a full HD resolution in portrait. The resources used are the same but the corresponding graphical layout elements are arranged differently.
