## CSS {#css}

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a formating language for HTML documents. With CSS you can set out for example the color and font preferences for certain text. The formatting possibilities of CSS are comprehensive and even include definitions of animations. The basic principle of CSS is to seperate the display (in CSS) of content and structure. The current version of CSS is CSS3.

## HTML {#html}

## JavaScript {#js}

JavaScript (abbreviated to JS) is a scripting language primarily used in the context of web browsers. Content can be generated, reload, changed or deleted within an HTML document using JavaScript. In addition it can react to specific events (i.e. a user input). The possibilities of HTML and CSS are significantly advanced with JavaScript. It's worth noting that for some time now the official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript (in order to avoid being confused with the Java programming language). The current version is ECMAScript 5.

## RSS {#rss}

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML syntax for news and annoucements. An RSS feed for your site is essentially an XML file. You must adhere to a specific format for the XML file to be identified as an RSS feed. The RSS format has undergone some syntax and naming changes over time. The current version is RSS 2.0.  

## Wake On LAN {#wakeonlan}

Wake on LAN (abbreviated to WoL) allows you start up a computer via a dedicated network command. For this a small data packet is sent to the network card of the shutdown computer by an active computer in the network. The computer then starts itself up. Wake on LAN is an industry stardard and must be supported by the network card.

## Wake On Power {#wakeonpower}

Wake On Power allows the computer to start up as soon as power is activated. This feature must be supported by the BIOS of the computer. The advantage of Wake On Power is that absolutely no power is required during the time the computer is off.

## Wake On Standby {#wakeonstandby}

Wake On Standby allows a computer to be woken up from power saving mode automatically using its built-in power management. For this the comptuer is not completely powered off but runs in a special low-power mode (Standby) that allows it to react to specific events. A schedule is initialized as a event during Wake On Standby that signals the system to start up at a given time.
