# Introduction

CONFIRE SHOWTIME is a digital signage software for creating, editing, managing, publishing and presenting digital content.

CONFIRE SHOWTIME consists of two parts: a Designer and a Player. With CONFIRE SHOWTIME DESIGNER you create your content and publish the result in the local network or on the internet. CONFIRE SHOWTIME PLAYER is installed on the computer of the public display. It will then download and play your content automatically on the screen.

All digital content is created based on the same web technologies you see everyday on the internet i.e. [HTML], [CSS] and [JavaScript]. For this we've developed a JavaScript library called showtime.js which serves as a framework for creating and playing your content. For presenting the contact on your screen we use a customized version of Chromium, an Open Source project from Google which also serves as a basis for the well-known Chrome web browser. 

So what kind of content can you create? Pretty much anything your heart desires. You can either insert content using the pre-installed elements (i.e. shapes, text, photo, video, slideshow, PDF), apps (i.e. weather, RSS news, DAVINCI timetables and substitution plans), or you can develop your own apps based on  HTML and embed those into CONFIRE SHOWTIME.
