# System requirements

CONFIRE SHOWTIME is compatible with the following operating systems:

* Windows 7 / 8 / 10 / 2008 / 2012 / 2016 (64-bit)
* Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 10 / 2008 (32-bit)

The hardware requirements of CONFIRE SHOWTIME depend on your own usage scenario. If you simply want to display static information then you won't require an especially powerful PC. With high resolution videos or complex  HTML5 animations then a more capable graphics card, CPUs and memory would have to be factored in.

Would you like to order your display hardware and software all from the same place? We will be happy to provide you with our [CONFIRE E-BOARDS]. You can receive all components (public display, industrial computer and software) in one complete package. Of course, CONFIRE SHOWTIME comes preinstalled on all CONFIRE E-BOARDS.
