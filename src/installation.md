# Installation

There are two different installers for CONFIRE SHERLOCK:

* `ConfireShowtime64.msi` is the installer for 64-bit versions of Windows.
* `ConfireShowtime32.msi` is the installer for 32-bit versions of Windows.

If you're not sure which one is right for your computer try the 64-bit version first. The installer will detect whether you're attempting to install it on the wrong windows version and in which case you can then try the 32-bit version instead.

The 32-bit version of CONFIRE SHOWTIME can be installed under Windows 64-bit but not visa-versa and it's also not possible to run both versions in parallel. Either installer will detect an existing installation and advise you of that.
