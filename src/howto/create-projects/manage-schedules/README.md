# Managing Schedules

Schedules allow you to switch between various Showcases automatically. Optionally the system can be shutdown completely at a given time. A schedule contains a list of tasks which are launched by a specific event (such as starting the Player or by a given point in time).

To use schedules click on `Schedules` in the left Navigation Panel of the Designer.
