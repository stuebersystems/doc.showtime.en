# Text Elements

With text elements you can display text in a layout. Text can be entered directly or linked as a text resource. The text editor in CONFIRE SHOWTIME supports [Markdown].

## Add a Text element

1. Click on `LAYOUTS > Text`. A dialog window opens.

3. Enter a meaningful name for the new layout element.

4. Select a `Source` as either `Resource` or `Embedded Text`.

   1. With `Resource` you must select a text resource in the next step.
   2. With `Embedded Text` you can type in text  in the next step.

6.  Make any final changes in the next step then confirm with `OK`.

The new text element is now displayed in the current layout. You can modify the size, position and rotation via Drag & Drop.

## Properties of a Text Element

When you highlight a text element in a layout with the mouse all properties of the element are displayed on the right hand side.
