# Create Projects

With CONFIRE SHOWTIME DESIGNER you create projects which you can publish later on. A project consists of the following layered components:

* Resources
* Layouts
* Showcases 
* Schedules

The chapter [The Basics](../../foundation.md) explains what functions these components have in your project.
