# Managing Videos

When you want to add videos to your project you first need to decide whether you want to import a single video file or a whole folder of videos (video collection).

A video collection allows you to play a large amount of videos consecutively.

## Import a Video File

1. Click on `RESOURCES > Video > Video File`. A dialog window opens to select the file.

2. Select the desired file and confirm by clicking `Open`. Another dialog window opens.

4. Select whether you would like to insert your video file as an embedded file or as an external link. When selecting the first option the file is copied into the project itself  (embedded resource). When selecting the second option the file path is simply saved (external resource).

5. Confirm by clicking `OK`.
