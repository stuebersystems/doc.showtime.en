# Send Projects

CONFIRE SHOWTIME projects consist generally of a multitude of files:

* A project file with the file extension `.shtproj`
* A special subfolder containing all embedded file resources.

If you want to copy a project, to make a backup or send via email then it's important not to miss a file you will end up with an inconsistent project. 

The solution for this problem are project archives. A project archive is a ZIP file with the file extrension `.shtarc` that contains all files i.e. the project file and embedded file resources. With CONFIRE SHOWTIME it's easy to create project archives and open them again.
