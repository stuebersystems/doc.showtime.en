4. Now select the previously defined FTP folder and click on `Publish`. 

CONFIRE SHOWTIME creates a project archive and copies it to the FTP server. As soon as you make any further changes to your project, publish it once again. CONFIRE SHOWTIME remembers the last place you saved to so that you can repeat this process with just a few clicks.

See more information on FTP publication targets in the following [Reference Chapter](../../reference/publishing/ftp.md).
